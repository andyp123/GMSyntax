GM Syntax
=========

[GameMonkey](http://www.gmscript.com/) Syntax for Sublime Text.

In addition to the basic syntax definition, this package also contains snippets to improve your workflow when writing GameMonkey code.

Included Snippets
-----------------

Currently there is only one snippet, but I hope to expand this over time to build up a library of actually useful snippets instead of just writing them for any common code construct I can think of.

The text in bold is the tab trigger. Typing this and pressing the `tab` key will activate the snippet.

*fun*ction : function definition. (name, argument(s), body)
